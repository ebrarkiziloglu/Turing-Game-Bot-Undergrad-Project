# CMPE 492 - LLM-driven Turing Game Bot

This repository contains my Senior Project ([CMPE 492](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/tr/courses/cmpe492)) at Boƒüazi√ßi University, supervised by [Suzan √úsk√ºdarlƒ±](https://uskudarli.gitlab.io/uskudarli-academic/) and [Onur G√ºng√∂r](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~onurgu/).

## About the Project
The goal of this project was to develop an **intelligent chatbot** capable of playing the [Turing Game](https://www.turinggame.ai/), where users attempt to distinguish humans from AI participants.  

Key features of the bot:  
* Engages in **natural, human-like conversations**  
* Uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to improve performance over time  
* Successfully **deceived at least one human in 31% of sessions** during evaluation

## Key Results
* In 93 valid Turing Game sessions, the bot successfully deceived at least one human in **31% of games** (0.49 persons per session on average), surpassing the minimum target of 20%. 
* The system remained stable, with only 27 sessions excluded due to technical issues.  
* Analysis revealed detectable patterns in message length, vocabulary, and conversation flow ‚Äî providing clear directions for future improvements in naturalness, topic transitions, and multilingual code-switching.

## Future Work
Planned improvements include:

- Enhancing prompt design for more varied and human-like responses  
- Supporting multi-user game formats for richer interaction  
- Introducing features like an ‚ÄúI cannot decide‚Äù option and turn-taking controls  
- Testing with native English speakers for comparative analysis
